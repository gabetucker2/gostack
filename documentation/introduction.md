 ***Go***, despite its elegance, can be excruciating.  We often find ourselves writing tedious code to complete conceptually simple tasks, adding a layer of complexity that distracts from the goal.  ***gostack*** introduces a novel system for data management which abstracts this layer of complexity into flexible yet intuitive functions so that you can focus on what matters.

 ***gostack*** introduces two new structs—the **Card** and the **Stack**—which intend to evoke the image of a stack of cards.  **Stacks**, which replace arrays, maps, and matrices, contain a set of **Cards**.  **Cards** can store **Stacks**, thereby making **Stacks** a recursive data structure.  This allows ***gostack***'s functions to...

 * abstract away for-loops, if-statements, and recursive functions
 * seamlessly translate between **Stacks** and existing arrays, maps, and matrices
 * filter through **Cards** in a **Stack** by any desired search criteria
 * dynamically update **Cards** within a **Stack** according to those criteria
 * effortlessly print all relevant information surrounding a **Card** or a **Stack** to facilitate debugging
 * create additional avenues through which any problem can be approached

This library was built to be as general-purpose as possible so that any coding project with data structures would benefit from ***gostack***.  The idea is that every possible thing you could need to code is broken into some modular function in ***gostack***.
