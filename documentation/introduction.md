<h1>Introduction</h1>

***Go***, despite its elegance, can be excruciating.  We often find ourselves writing tedious code to complete conceptually simple tasks, adding a layer of complexity that distracts from the goal.  ***gostack***'s novel approach to data management abstracts this layer of complexity into all-purpose, intuitive functions so that you can focus more on what matters.

 ***gostack*** introduces two new structs—the **Card** and the **Stack**—which intend to evoke the image of a stack of cards.  **Stacks**, which replace arrays, maps, and matrices, contain a set of **Cards**.  **Cards** can store **Stacks** (which are in turn called **Substacks**), thereby making **Stacks** a recursive data structure.  This allows ***gostack***'s functions to...

 * abstract away for-loops, if-statements, and recursive functions
 * seamlessly translate between **Stacks** and existing arrays, maps, and matrices
 * filter through **Cards** in a **Stack** by any desired search criteria
 * dynamically update **Cards** within a **Stack** according to those criteria
 * effortlessly print all relevant information surrounding a **Card** or a **Stack** to facilitate debugging
 * create additional avenues through which any problem can be approached

This library was built to be as general purpose as possible, meaning any coding project will benefit from ***gostack***.
