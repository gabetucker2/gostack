 6/18/2022 — Development begins

 <h1>Current Releases</h1>

 <h2><b>v0.8.0</b> — <i>Alpha Release</i> — 7/24/2022 — Prerelease A</h2>

* ***gostack***'s initial non-working release
* Initialized most function, meaning you are able to call them from other scripts

 <h2><b>v0.8.5</b> — <i>Alpha Release</i> — 8/24/2022 — Prerelease B</h2>

* Significantly improved **gostack** documentation
* Reworked many ***gostack*** functions' functionality

 <h2><b>v0.9.0</b> — <i>Alpha Release</i> — 8/28/2022 — Prerelease C</h2>

* Implemented the **stack.Equals()** and **card.Equals()** functions
* Redesigned significant portions of ***gostack*** memory management

 <h2><b>v1.0.0</b> — <i>Beta Release</i> — 10/16/2022 — First working implementation</h2>

* ***gostack***'s initial working release
* Every function is fully implemented and case-tested

 <h1>Planned Releases</h1>

 <h2><b>v1.0.4</b> — <i>Beta Release</i> — 10/?/2022 — Post-release polish</h2>

* ***gostack*** is finally opened to the public
* ***gostack*** receives a documentation overhaul
* ***gostack***'s functions' default parameter values have been adjusted to make more intuitive sense
* ***gostack*** gains the **MakeSubstack()** function
* ***gostack***'s functions' parameter naming has been adjusted to be more consistent
* The **Depth** property of **Stacks** is renamed to **Height** to improve conceptual clarity
* The **Idx**, **Height**, and **Size** properties are updated to type `*int`
  * This ensures, for instance, that you can make a set containing the indices of a set of cards which updates as the cards' orders change.  Otherwise, you can only make a set representing their indices at the time the set was created.
* ***gostack***'s default parameter orderings have been adjusted to decrease the likelihood of having to pass repeated `nil` values
* Removed all files that won't be in the full release (e.g., `unaddedcases.txt`)
