<h2>OVERRIDE</h2>

 > True, False

An enumerator which allows you to configure whether or not you "override" a certain default argument interpretation.

For instance, if you pass a card as your `insert` argument into the `stack.Add()` function, then the function will automatically add that card to your stack.  If you would like to "override" this parameter and instead have the function add a card to your stack whose val is the `insert` card (i.e., add a card pointing to your card), then you would set override to true.

Enumerators:
 > OVERRIDE_True

 > OVERRIDE_False
