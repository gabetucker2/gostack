GABE:
* Create function annotation convention
* Make ORDER_*, POSITION_* optional for add function (only if first value being inserted)
* Function cleanup
 - Ensure public functions are capital whereas private functions are lowercase
 - Restructure functions to have receiver of type Stack AND Card
 - Restructure all functions
* Implement all documented functions
* Implement rest of functions in ToAdd documentation
* Update gostack banner to have code from a tutorial

---------------------------------------------------------------
ANDY:
* Implement case tests for functions listed in IMPLEMENTED UNTESTED DOCUMENTED FUNCTIONS list below (make sure to implement them in order)
 - See unaddedcases.txt for reference
* Fix faulty classical go code in tutorials/race.md
 - I am avoiding for-loop cloning incorrectly since the for-loop is iterating over a map, see my StackOverflow post https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20185511/range-references-instead-values/72740187#72740187
 - The initial map cannot have two of the same key, meaning we have to implement x_KEYNAME for each key in the map and then decode this within the procedure
* Lambda tutorial updates
 - Replace makeSampleStack() with MakeStack() from frontend.go
 - Make some more lambda function examples which use workingMemory param
 - Remove mainFunc, replace mainFunc calls in Lambda() with Get()
* Implement bootstrap functions, take inspiration from common functions in other languages
* Add some more tutorials using functions in the documentation even if they haven't been implemented yet
