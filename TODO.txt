* Document MakeCards/MakeStacks functions... make MakeCards have one optional argument... if called, assume it's the map pair values and that the 2nd arg is the keys... MakeCard(s) should be only function with support for interface{} input type
* Make STRUCTURE_Map/STRUCTURE_Arr enum for MakeCards()
* Make ORDER_*, POSITION_* optional for add/fill functions (only if first values being inserted)

* Ensure public functions are capital whereas private functions are lowercase
* Restructure functions to have receiver of type Stack AND Card
* Restructure all functions

* Implement tutorials
* Implement case tests

* Update gostack banner to have code using frontend
