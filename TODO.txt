---------------------------------------------------------------
GABE:
* Implement all documented functions
* Turn MakeStack into a more flexible function, intialize with keys (instead of values) option
* Implement getPositions
* Implement variadic error-catching function for bad argument conditions (fmt.Errorf())
* Update gostack banner to have code from a tutorial

---------------------------------------------------------------
ANDY:
* Implement case tests for functions listed in IMPLEMENTED UNTESTED DOCUMENTED FUNCTIONS list below (make sure to implement them in order)
 - See unaddedcases.txt for reference
* Fix faulty classical go code in tutorials/race.md
 - I am avoiding for-loop cloning incorrectly since the for-loop is iterating over a map, see my StackOverflow post https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20185511/range-references-instead-values/72740187#72740187
 - Remove comments saying "avoid for-loop cloning"
 - Update percentage descriptions corresponding to amount of lines after update
 - The initial map cannot have two of the same key, meaning we have to implement x_KEYNAME for each key in the map and then decode this within the procedure
* Lambda tutorial updates
 - Replace makeSampleStack() with MakeStack() from frontend.go
 - Implement for values other than ints
 - Make some more lambda function examples which use workingMemory param
 - Remove MainFunc, replace MainFunc calls in Lambda() with Get() and other frontend functions
* Implement bootstrap functions, take inspiration from common functions in other languages
* Add some more tutorials using functions in the documentation even if they haven't been implemented yet
 - Add passing-by-object vs passing-by-address tutorial (just & before variable, our functions support that)
